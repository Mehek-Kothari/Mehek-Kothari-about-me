        <p>A career is something that you do for your entire life. It is what makes you happy and provides a good living for you. Highschool is normally the time people decided what they want to do and achieve. Some people have known since elementary school. For me, I don't know what I want to be yet, currently I am exploring my options. However, currently some career paths I am intrested in are engineering and psycology! In orderto achieve this end of goal I am currently taking CSE (Computer Science Engineering) and I plan to take psycology and AP CSP next year. In addition, over summer I took a course at Santa Monica College (SMC), a begginers course to engineering. I decided to take this course because I wanted to learn more about coding and how it is important as well as the basics of python, java script, and HTML.</p>
        <p>I have been playing soccer for the past 7 years and that has taught me many life skills that have helped me in so many other ways. Soccer has made me more organized adn resilliant. When something doesn't go my way I have learnt how to figure it out and find a way to get back on track. I know life is going to coninue to throw obstacles in my way and I need to learn how to face those challenges. I am also very persistent, I never give up once I have started something and I am independant however, I work well with a team. Playing a team sport I learnt that in order to be successful in anything communicatin is key, so when working in a team or working with others it is important to always acknowledge others and their ideas, as well as ask for help when needed. I also started a small photography buisness this year. This has taught me a lot about independence because when I arrive at an event it is my job to introduce myself. Since I am not an adult yet many people tend to ignore me when I am taking photos so when in those cases I kindly address the matter in order to stay polite as well as show my place.</p>
<p>In order to start taking part in more engineering courses I signed up for a drone coding camp over summer and a robots camp. In the robotics camp we were sorted into groups of about 5-6 people. While in the drone coding camp we were all working in pairs. I think I made a lot out of this experience because I learned so much along the way on how to code, how to face certain obstacles, and how to speak in front of hundreds of people. My partner and I won first place out of 30 teams in the drone coding competition, and my etam won 2nd place in the robotics competition out of about 6 teams. I also recently took part of a hackathon, consisting of about 150-200 people. We working from early morning to late in the evening on our project and even created an app as well as website version of our idea. We decided to make and app/website that was a study resource to people who were underprivilleged by making it more organized and easily accesible. It was important that we provided many uses of the app/website so people would use it. However, when it was our turn to present our time was cut down from 5-7 minute to 1-2 minutes. This was a very last minute issue which caught me and my partner off-guard. We were able to finish our presentatiion however, we missed out some key details due to the time. We did not win 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place however, I didn't realize my abilities and what I had the capability to create until I took part in that hackathon. As mentioned before I have been playing soccer for the past 7 years and I recently started a photography business.<p>
<p>Overall, I have had many different experiences and I have learnt so much from all of them. Each acitivy I have particpated in has made me grow further and realize where my strengths and weaknesses lie. I am glad I decided try new things when I ahd the time because certain skills I gain form these experiences have helped me in every day life. Thank you for your time to read a little bit about me, feel free to take a look at my website!<p>
